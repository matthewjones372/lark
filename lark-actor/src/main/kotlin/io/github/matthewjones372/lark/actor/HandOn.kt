 * stopped, where a tell is a dead letter. Otherwise it is kept, in order, under its key, and everything after it for
 * that key waits behind it. Past [KEEP_AT_MOST] kept under one key, a message is a dead letter for being
 * [DeadLetter.Why.Full]. The step calls [drain] on a timer of its own while anything is kept, and `awaitIdle` counts
 * what is kept as not yet handled. Each is kept with what its handling carried, and handed on inside it (spec 0122).

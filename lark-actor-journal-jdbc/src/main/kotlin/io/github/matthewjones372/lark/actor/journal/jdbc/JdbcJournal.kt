 * A [Journal] in one `lark_journal` table, reached through [dataSource], so that every node that reaches the same
 * database reads the same events. The table ships in the jar as a Liquibase changelog in formatted SQL,
 * `lark/journal/jdbc/postgres.sql`; the service's changelog includes it, and nothing here creates it.
 *
 * Of two writers for one id, the table's primary key decides: an append inserts its first event only if the one it
 * expects to follow is there, and two that both expect it collide on the key, so exactly one commits. A database
 * that cannot answer throws its [SQLException].
 *
 * Each row carries its id's slice (spec 0105), and an append for a slice listed in `lark_journal_fenced`, one this
 * database has given to another, is refused in the append's own statement with [SliceElsewhere].
 *
 * It is a [JournalFeed] too (spec 0075), its offsets the table's `ordering`. An append takes its `ordering` when it
 * inserts and is seen when it commits, so a smaller one can commit after a larger one is read: the feed answers
 * nothing past a missing `ordering` until it fills, or until it is known never to: then it is taken for an append
 * that never committed and passed, with a warning. On Postgres that is once every transaction running when the gap
 * was first seen has ended (spec 0100), so an append whose writer is slow to commit, however slow, is waited for,
 * and one rolled back is passed within a second; [longestAppend] bounds the wait for a writer that never ends. On a
 * database without transaction snapshots it is once the gap has been missing for [gapTimeout].

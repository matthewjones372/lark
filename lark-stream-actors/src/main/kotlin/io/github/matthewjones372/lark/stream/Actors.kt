 * lark-stream on lark-actor: a run is an actor of [flock]'s, which pulls the run's loop [batch] elements at a time
 * and then tells itself to go on, so runs share the flock's runners and a long one never holds one. A stage that
 * blocks parks its runner, as any step may. The operators that run something beside the loop start it from [on],
 * as on [Forks]. Time is lark's `clock`, read when the run starts. A run cannot outlive [flock]: its close stops it.

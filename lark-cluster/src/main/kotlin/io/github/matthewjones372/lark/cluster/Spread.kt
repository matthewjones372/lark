/**
 * [count] actors named [name], worker 0 to worker `count - 1`, spread over the `Up` members as evenly as they go
 * (spec 0106): each runs on the member it hashes to among those short of their share, started as soon as it is
 * placed, with nothing sent to it, and moved by the same handoff as a singleton when that member leaves or is
 * downed, so it never runs on two members at once. Every node calls this with the same [name] and [count]. With a
 * [role], only members started with it run workers.
 *
 * What it is for is work with no messages to wait for, such as a read model's partitions, which would otherwise
 * pile up as singletons on the oldest member.

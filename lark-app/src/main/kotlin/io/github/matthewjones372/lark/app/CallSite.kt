/**
 * The first frame outside lark's own node factories, as a source path and a line.
 *
 * `single` and `singleOf` are inline, so their frames are the caller's already; `actor` and
 * `migrations` are not, and naming those would put every actor node in `lark-app-pekko`. A lark
 * factory is always a top-level function, so its frame is a file facade, which is what the `Kt`
 * distinguishes from a caller written as a class.
 *
 * The package rides along as a directory — `com/petshop/Wiring.kt:92` rather than `Wiring.kt:92` —
 * because a build that wants to turn this into a link has only the source directories to search, and
 * two modules in a project each having a `Wiring.kt` is the normal case rather than the exotic one.
 * Everything that prints a site for a person to read trims it back.

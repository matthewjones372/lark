/**
 * The findings in the shape a build tool already knows how to make clickable.
 *
 * `e: file:///abs/Wiring.kt:92:1 message` is what the Kotlin compiler prints, which is why it is
 * what this prints: the IDE parses a build's output looking for exactly that, and turns the ones it
 * finds into entries in the Build window that jump to the line. A report only a person can read is
 * a report they have to search their own source for.
 *
 * [sources] are the source directories the sites are relative to. A finding whose site names no file
 * under any of them — or which has no site at all, as a cycle does not — still gets a line, without
 * a location, because a fault nobody can link to is still a fault.
 *
 * [provided] is what the graph does build, which a missing key is compared against: `Tracer` missing
 * from a graph holding `Tracer!` is the report worth having.

 * A service file naming a class that cannot link — an adapter whose own dependency is not on the
 * classpath is the way this happens — makes `ServiceLoader` throw while instantiating it. That would
 * land on whoever wrote the first log line or took the first measurement, which is the one place an
 * observability problem must never surface.
 *
 * The fallback is said out loud, because a service quietly recording nothing is the same outcome as
 * this catching nothing.

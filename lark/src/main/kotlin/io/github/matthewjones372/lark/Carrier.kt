 * What rides a message from the thread that sent it to the one that handles it (spec 0122): a fork's
 * locals cross a fork, and a carrier is how the ones that matter cross a `tell` too.
 *
 * Registered through `META-INF/services`, as the logger is, so a module on the classpath carries its
 * own: `lark` carries `logAnnotated`'s annotations, `lark-otel` the trace. A map of strings, because
 * that is what crosses a node as it is, and what every propagator already reads and writes.

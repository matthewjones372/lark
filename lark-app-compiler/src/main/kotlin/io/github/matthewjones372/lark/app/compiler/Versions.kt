/**
 * Whether this plugin is running in the compiler it was built against.
 *
 * Everything it touches — a checker's signature, a diagnostic's constructor, how a symbol is
 * resolved — is compiler API with no stability promise, and a plugin built for one minor version
 * and loaded into another does not fail in a way anybody sees: the compiler may report a linkage
 * error, and the editor drops the checker and says nothing. Comparing the two is the difference
 * between a sentence and a silence.
 *
 * Major and minor, because that is what the compiler's own API moves on; a patch release has never
 * been what breaks this, and refusing one would turn every upgrade into a wait for a lark release.

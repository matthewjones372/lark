/**
 * A backend for tests, on time the test owns: `tick`, `groupedWithin` and `restartOnDefect`'s delays wait
 * on [clock], and on nothing else, so an hour of ticks is one `clock.adjust(1.hours)`.
 *
 * It is the [Forks] pull loop, and so runs the operators Forks does, those three besides, and refuses the
 * rest by its own name. One stage runs at a time, in the same order every time. `start` returns once the
 * run is over or waiting on a later time, and each move of [clock] returns once everything due by then
 * has run, in time order: a test reads top to bottom, and nothing is left running behind an assertion.
 *
 * A stage body that blocks on anything but [clock] blocks the test with it.
